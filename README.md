# mtkclient-installer
I made this to simplify tech support work I've been doing on XDA discord server in case I ever become inactive there. This code for the most part will be self-updating as it searches for latest releases.
### Only for Windows because I can't test on mac/linux

## What will this install
- winfsp
- usbdk
- git (64/32 bit)
- Mediatek drivers
- mtkclient
Once you've installed all these, it will automatically open a command prompt on mtkclient folder so you can just run the command be done with it.
