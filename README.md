# mtkclient-installer
I made this to simplify tech support work I've been doing on XDA discord server in case I ever become inactive there. This code for the most part will be self-updating as it searches for latest releases.
### Only for Windows because I can't test on mac/linux

## Installation
- Download [python](https://www.python.org/)
- Open python installation wizard, click Add as PATH on the bottom
- Open `main.py` script

- Download it

- Move `main.py` on your downloads folder to another folder you want to install mtkclient on
- Run `main.py` via opening a command prompt on the same folder (right-click, open in terminal for win 11 users) and then running `python main.py` (Or probably just run it by double clicking the python file)
- Follow the instructions given

## What will this install
- winfsp
- usbdk
- git (64/32 bit)
- Mediatek drivers
- mtkclient
Once you've installed all these, it will automatically open a command prompt on mtkclient folder so you can just run the command be done with it.
